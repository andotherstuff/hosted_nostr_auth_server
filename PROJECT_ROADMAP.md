# ChusMe Auth Server: Complete Project Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document provides the comprehensive roadmap for migrating the ChusMe Auth Server from its current half-finished WebSocket implementation to a production-ready HTTP API using Cloudflare Durable Objects.

**Current State**: Half-finished NIP-46 signing service with mismatched FROST WASM and broken authentication  
**Target State**: Production-ready HTTP API with proper FROST implementation and secure authentication  
**Timeline**: 10 weeks  
**Risk Level**: Medium (well-planned migration with rollback capabilities)

## Critical Issues Resolved

‚úÖ **Architecture Decision**: Durable Objects for FROST ceremony state management  
‚úÖ **WASM Strategy**: Replace DKG-based module with Trusted Dealer using zcash/frost-core  
‚úÖ **Authentication**: JWT-based stateless authentication with refresh tokens  
‚úÖ **Security Model**: HKDF key derivation, rate limiting, constant-time operations  
‚úÖ **Migration Strategy**: Feature flags with graceful rollout and instant rollback

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Durable Objects Architecture
- **Main Worker**: Stateless router handling auth and request forwarding
- **FrostCeremonyDO**: Stateful actor managing individual ceremony lifecycle  
- **Multi-key Storage**: Distributed state to avoid 128KB limits and enable atomic updates

### 2. HTTP-First API Design
- RESTful endpoints with clear semantics
- Idempotent operations for safe retries
- Transport-agnostic design (WebSocket upgrade possible later)
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

### 3. Security-by-Design
- Unguessable operation IDs using `crypto.randomUUID()`
- Participant authorization validation per ceremony
- Constant-time cryptographic operations
- Proper secret zeroization and memory management
