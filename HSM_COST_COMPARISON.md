# HSM Cost Comparison for Testing FROST Implementation

## Summary: AWS CloudHSM is expensive for testing, but there are better options

### Cost Comparison Table

| Provider | Setup Cost | Testing Cost (1 week) | Production Cost/Month |
|----------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **AWS CloudHSM** | $0 | **$242** (24/7) or $24 (2hr/day) | **$1,050** |
| **Google Cloud HSM** | $0 | **$5-20** (operation-based) | $50-500 |
| **Azure Key Vault HSM** | $0 | **$10-30** (key + operation-based) | $100-1000 |
| **AWS KMS (HSM-backed)** | $0 | **$2-5** (operation-based) | $20-200 |
| **Simulated HSM** | $0 | **$0** | $0 |

## Recommended Testing Strategy

### **Phase 1: Start with Simulated HSM (This Week)**
```typescript
// Cost: $0
// Time to setup: 10 minutes
// Perfect for validating architecture and UX

const hsm = await createHSMFrost({
  hsmProvider: 'simulated',
  fallbackToSoftware: true
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero cost
- Immediate testing
- Real security model validation
- UX testing with zero-storage auth

### **Phase 2: Google Cloud HSM (Next Week)**
```bash
# Much cheaper for testing
# ~$0.15 per 1,000 operations
# Only pay for what you use

gcloud kms keyrings create frost-testing --location=global
gcloud kms keys create frost-key --location=global \
  --keyring=frost-testing --purpose=asymmetric-signing \
  --default-algorithm=ec-sign-secp256k1-sha256
```

**Cost for testing:**
- 1,000 FROST operations: ~$0.15
- 10 keys stored for a month: ~$0.50
- **Total weekly testing cost: <$5**

### **Phase 3: AWS KMS (HSM-backed) for Validation**
```typescript
// $0.03 per 10,000 operations
// $1 per key per month
// HSM-backed but managed service

const kmsClient = new KMSClient({ region: 'us-east-1' });
```

**Cost for testing:**
- 10,000 operations: $0.03
- 5 keys for testing: $5/month
- **Total weekly testing cost: ~$2**

### **Phase 4: AWS CloudHSM (When Ready for Production)**
Only move to dedicated CloudHSM when:
- You've validated the architecture works
- You need dedicated hardware compliance
- You have sufficient volume to justify $1,050/month

## Updated Implementation Strategy

### Week 1: Simulated HSM (Free)
- Validate zero-storage authentication
- Test FROST workflows
- User experience testing
- Architecture validation

### Week 2: Google Cloud HSM ($5-20)
- Real HSM testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Security validation
- Attestation testing

### Week 3: AWS KMS Testing ($2-5)
- Alternative HSM approach
- Cost optimization
- Compliance validation

### Week 4+: Production Decision
- Choose between Google/AWS/Azure based on:
  - Cost requirements
  - Compliance needs
  - Performance requirements
  - Integration complexity

## Google Cloud HSM Quick Start (Recommended)

### Setup (15 minutes)
```bash
# Install Google Cloud CLI
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
exec -l $SHELL

# Login and setup project
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Enable APIs
gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com
```

### Create HSM Keys for FROST
```bash
# Create keyring
gcloud kms keyrings create frost-testing --location=global

# Create FROST threshold signing keys
for i in {1..3}; do
  gcloud kms keys create "frost-participant-$i" \
    --location=global \
    --keyring=frost-testing \
    --purpose=asymmetric-signing \
    --default-algorithm=ec-sign-secp256k1-sha256 \
    --protection-level=hsm
done
```

### Cost Monitoring
```bash
# Check current costs
gcloud billing budgets list

# Set budget alert
gcloud billing budgets create \
  --billing-account=YOUR_BILLING_ACCOUNT \
  --display-name="HSM Testing Budget" \
  --budget-amount=50
```

## Immediate Recommendation

**Start with Simulated HSM today** (free), then move to **Google Cloud HSM next week** ($5-20 total cost). This gives you:

1. ✅ Real architecture validation
2. ✅ Actual HSM testing experience  
3. ✅ Minimal cost during experimentation
4. ✅ Easy migration path to production HSMs

AWS CloudHSM is excellent for production but at $1.45/hour, it's overkill for initial testing and development.
