## üî• CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Issue #15: Complete FROST Round 2 Implementation in WASM
**Priority**: Critical  
**Labels**: `critical`, `crypto`, `wasm`, `incomplete`

**Description**:
The Rust WASM implementation currently only has real FROST for Round 1 keygen. Round 2 keygen and both signing rounds still use mock data.

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ Round 1 keygen: REAL FROST DKG using zcash/frost-core
- ‚ùå Round 2 keygen: Mock implementation (TODO in Rust code)
- ‚ùå Signing Round 1: Mock implementation 
- ‚ùå Signing Round 2: Mock implementation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Implement real Round 2 keygen in `frost-wasm-core/src/lib.rs:keygen_round2()`
- [ ] Implement real signing Round 1 in `frost-wasm-core/src/lib.rs:signing_round1()`
- [ ] Implement real signing Round 2 in `frost-wasm-core/src/lib.rs:signing_round2()`
- [ ] Replace all TODO comments with actual zcash/frost-core calls
- [ ] Update state management to handle real cryptographic data
- [ ] Test that full keygen‚Üísigning workflow produces valid signatures

**Files to Update**:
- `frost-wasm-core/src/lib.rs` lines 175-386 (all TODO sections)

### Issue #16: Fix State Persistence in Durable Objects
**Priority**: Critical  
**Labels**: `critical`, `durable-objects`, `bug`

**Description**:
The DurableObject implementation needs to properly store and retrieve FROST ceremony state between rounds.

**Current Issues**:
- Round 1 packages not being properly stored for Round 2 processing
- State serialization/deserialization may be lossy
- Need proper error handling for state corruption

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Fix Round 1 package storage in `FrostCeremonyDO.ts:processRoundData()`
- [ ] Implement proper state validation on load
- [ ] Add state migration logic for format changes
- [ ] Test state persistence across DO hibernation/wake cycles
- [ ] Verify atomic storage operations work correctly

### Issue #17: Implement Trusted Dealer Key Generation
**Priority**: High  
**Labels**: `high`, `crypto`, `trusted-dealer`

**Description**:
Current implementation uses DKG (Distributed Key Generation) but the architecture calls for Trusted Dealer mode where server generates and distributes key shares.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Implement `generate_frost_shares()` with real trusted dealer logic
- [ ] Use server-generated private key to create participant shares
- [ ] Ensure shares can be used for signing ceremonies
- [ ] Add key import functionality (hex private key ‚Üí FROST shares)
- [ ] Test that trusted dealer keys work for signing

## üîß REFACTORING & IMPROVEMENTS

### Issue #18: Clean Up Legacy WebSocket Implementation
**Priority**: Medium  
**Labels**: `cleanup`, `technical-debt`

**Description**:
The old WebSocket implementation in `src/index.ts` contains critical security vulnerabilities and should be completely removed or secured.

**Security Issues Found**:
- Password transmitted in every signing request (`src/index.ts:310`)
- In-memory state using global `wsUserMap` (`src/index.ts:200`)
- No proper authentication flow
- Expensive PBKDF2 on every sign operation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Either remove WebSocket implementation entirely OR
- [ ] Secure it to use JWT authentication
- [ ] Remove password transmission in sign requests
- [ ] Replace in-memory state with proper persistence
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for any remaining WebSocket code

---

### Issue #19: Implement Comprehensive Input Validation
**Priority**: High  
**Labels**: `security`, `validation`, `zod`

**Description**:
Add proper schema validation for all API endpoints using Zod.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Create Zod schemas for all request/response types
- [ ] Validate participant IDs, operation IDs, cryptographic data
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Add request size limits
- [ ] Sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] Return structured error responses

### Issue #20: Fix Test Environment WASM Loading
**Priority**: Medium  
**Labels**: `testing`, `wasm`, `environment`

**Description**:
Tests currently fall back to mock implementation because WASM can't load in vitest environment.

**Current Issue**:
```
Failed to initialize FROST WASM module, using mock implementation: 
[TypeError: Fetch API cannot load: file:///Users/.../frost_wasm_core_bg.wasm]
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Configure vitest to load WASM modules properly
- [ ] Update test setup to handle WASM initialization
- [ ] Create integration tests that verify real FROST operations
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for WASM operations
- [ ] Ensure tests run in CI environment

## üìö DOCUMENTATION & MAINTENANCE

### Issue #21: Update Architecture Documentation
**Priority**: Medium  
**Labels**: `documentation`, `architecture`

### Issue #22: Add Operational Monitoring
**Priority**: High  
**Labels**: `monitoring`, `observability`, `production`
